```

Introduction
===============

This is a quick introduction to R. It's not meant to be a comprehensive
tutorial, but rather as a small, sturdy foothold to get you started. We will

The R prompt tells us that it's ready for us to type commands. Unlike other
programming languages, it's designed to be interactive.

Since this is an R Markdown document, we can interact and mix documentation and code
If you enclose a section in 3 backticks to signify the start of code, and 3 backticks
to signify the end, you can run this by hitting the green play button on the right 
corner of the shaded region.

```{r calculate_good_times_1}
1 + 100
```

```{r calculate_good_times_2}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```

```{r calculate_good_times_3}

# Give it a try, replace underscore with a number and remove # to uncomment

# 123 + ____


```

Mathmatical functions
===============

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function, we simply type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses. Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the functionâ€™s arguments:

```{r calculate_good_times_4}
sin(1)
log(1)
exp(0.5)
```


Variables
===============

Unlike a calculator, you can save the results of your calculations into
variables by using the . This
looks like an arrow pointing the results of the calculation on the right to the
variable on the left.

```{r its_magic_1}
# put the value 100 in variable

x <- 100

# check it out, we also see the variable x in our Global Environment pane under Values
```

```{r its_magic}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

> The '#' symbol is a "comment". R will ignore anything that comes after a
> comment, allowing you to write notes to yourself in your R script

Now that we saved the results into a variable, how do we look at it? All we have
to do is type the variable:

```{r magic_revealed}
x
y
```

Variables can be used in calculations.

```{r multiple_magic}
z <- x + 2
z
a <- y * 2
a
```

You can even overwrite variables.

```{r written_magic}
x <- "oh"
x
y <- "wow"
y
```

But single variables are not all that you can do In R. Read more to find out
about vectors!

Vectors
===============

R can store more than single values. It has 
These are sequences of data that are all of the same type (i.e. integers,
decimals, text (characters), and logical values (TRUE/FALSE)). To construct a 
vector, you can use the `c()` function (more about functions later):

```{r vector_me_this}
some_numbers <- c(10.0, pi, 47.5362, 3.50, 1.1111)
some_numbers  
some_integers <- c(NA, 1, 1, 2, 3) # NA is code for "missing" in R
some_integers 
more_integers <- 1:5 # same as c(1, 2, 3, 4), but a lot easier to type!
more_integers

some_logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
some_logic
```


### Vectorization

You can think about these as being similar to a column in an excel spreadhseet.
For example, if you wanted to take column A and square each number, you would
start by setting cell **B1** to `=A1^2` and then you would drag that down to
apply to the entire column.

Math works with vectors the same way in R:

```{r v_add_o}
some_integers ^ 2
```

> Note: "NA" is a missing value in R.

Again, if you tried to add two columns together in excel, you would type 
something like `=A1+B1` and then drag to apply to the column. R behaves the 
same way:

```{r v_drag}
some_integers + some_numbers
```

Data Import
===============

Of course, no one expects you to enter all of your data in R by hand. 
We'll preview importing a curated data set called gapminder

Often helpful code is bundled together in packages. To use a package
is a 2 step process:
* Installing the package
* Then telling R we want to enable the package for use

```{r}

# This checks first to see if the package is installed already, if so it skips
# Behind the scenes it looks like:
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("plyr")
#install.packages("gapminder")

requiredPackages = c('plyr','ggplot2','gapminder')
for(p in requiredPackages){
  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(p)
  library(p,character.only = TRUE)
}

```

Now we have to enable the package for this program using library("packagename")

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) #data

```

Plotting
=============

Since we loaded the gapminder library, we have access to the gapminder dataset.
We also loaded the ggplot plotting library, so we can start plotting some graphs!

```{r gapminder-plot}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r gapminder-plot-2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()

```


```{r gapminder-plot-3}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()

```

```{r gapminder-plot-4}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

```{r gapminder-plot-5}
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas",]
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap( ~ country) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))

```

Getting help
===============

One way that R shines above other languages is that R packages in CRAN are all
documented and easy to install. Help files are written in HTML and give the user
a brief overview of:

 - the purpose of a function
 - the parameters it takes
 - the output it yields
 - examples demonstrating its usage

To get help on any R function, type a question mark before the empty function. 
Here's an example of how to get help about the `gapminder()` function from the
*gapminder* package:

```{r}
library("gapminder") # The package with the gapminder function.
?gapminder               # open the R documentation of the function gapminder()
```

Other ways of getting help:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(package = "gapminder") # Get help for a package.
help("gapminder")               # Get help for the gapminder function
?gapminder                   # same as above

```
